Simple Chat Bot with Java

My second Java project from the Hyperskill Java Developer track that creates an interactive console chatbot capable of basic conversation and simple arithmetic operations.

About

This project serves as an introduction to fundamental programming concepts by building a console-based chatbot from scratch. The bot can engage in basic conversations, perform simple mathematical operations, and includes interactive word and number games

How It Works

The chatbot follows a structured conversation flow:
Introduction - Bot states its name and creation year
Name Collection - Asks for and remembers your name
Age Guessing - Interactive mathematical game using remainder calculations
Counting Demo - Shows counting abilities up to your chosen number
Knowledge Test - Quiz on Java programming concepts
Farewell - Congratulatory message upon completion
